npm install
```

3. Set up environment variables: Replace the .env.example file and add your variables in it
   Create a .env file in the `backend` directory with the following:

```
MONGO_URL = mongodb://localhost:27017/blogify
PORT = 3000
JWT_SECRET_KEY = your_JWT_SECRET_KEY
FRONTEND_URL = http://localhost:5173        # for development only
MODE = development                          # for development only

# AWS IAM Keys
ACCESS_KEY = your_ACCESS_KEY
SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = your_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
REGION = ap-south-1

# Google OAuth Keys
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID = your_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET = your_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET
GOOGLE_CALLBACK_URL = your_GOOGLE_CALLBACK_URL

GEMINI_API_KEY = your_GEMINI_API_KEY

REDIS_HOST = your_REDIS_HOST
REDIS_PASSWORD = your_REDIS_PASSWORD
REDIS_PORT = 6379
REDIS_TLS = false                # set `true` for production
```

Create a .env file in the `frontend` directory with these variables:

```
VITE_BASEURL = http://localhost:3000/api/v1         # modify for production deployment
VITE_TINYMCE_API_KEY = your_VITE_TINYMCE_API_KEY
```

5. Start the server

```
# Backend (in backend directory)
npm run dev
```

Inside a new terminal:

```
# Frontend (in frontend directory)
npm run dev
```
