// Hugging face
Hugging Face is a platform that provides access to pre-trained machine learning models, particularly for natural language processing (NLP) tasks like text generation, summarization, and text improvement. To use their API, you'll need an API key.
Step 1: Generate an API Key:
    Navigate to the "Access Tokens" section.
    Click "New Token," give it a name like "Blogify" and select the "Read" role (or "Write" if you plan to upload models later).
    Copy the generated API key and store it securely in a .env file, which we'll use later.

Step 2: Choosing a Model for Text Improvement. Here are some free tier models:
    1. facebook/bart-large-cnn: Summarization (can also refine text by condensing it).
    2. t5-base or t5-small: Text-to-text generation (can be used for paraphrasing or improving text).
    3. distilgpt2: Text generation (can extend or refine text creatively).
    Hugging Face Inference API:
        Hugging Face provides a free tier of its Inference API, which lets you send requests to their servers to run models and get results. The base URL for the Inference API is https://api-inference.huggingface.co/models/. You append the model name (e.g., t5-base) to this base URL to specify which model you want to use.
    Model Specification:
        The t5-base in the URL refers to a specific version of the T5 (Text-To-Text Transfer Transformer) model, originally developed by Google but hosted and maintained on Hugging Face. Hugging Face uses a naming convention where models are identified by their organization and name (e.g., google/t5-base), but for the Inference API, you often use a simplified name like t5-base if it’s a well-known model directly supported.
    How I Chose It:
        I selected t5-base because it’s a widely used, general-purpose text-to-text model that can handle tasks like paraphrasing, summarization, and text improvement with the right prompts. It’s available via the free Inference API, which aligns with your zero-budget constraint.

Step 3: Calling the API key in a route
    const response = await axios.post(
      process.env.API_URL,              // something like 'https://api-inference.huggingface.co/models/t5-base';
      { inputs: `Improve this text: ${text}` },
      {
        headers: {
          Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.HF_API_TOKEN}`,
          'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        },
      }
    );
    const improvedText = response.data[0].generated_text;
