    Popular Models: Tesseract, TrOCR, Vision Encoder Decoder (e.g., ViT-GPT).


3. Audio Processing
Audio tasks are growing in importance with the rise of voice assistants and audio-based applications:
Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR):
    Why: Converts spoken language to text, foundational for voice interfaces.
    Use Cases: Transcription services, voice assistants (e.g., Siri, Alexa), dictation software.
    Popular Models: Whisper (OpenAI), Wav2Vec2, DeepSpeech.
Text-to-Speech (TTS):
    Why: Converts text to natural-sounding speech, enhancing accessibility and user experience.
    Use Cases: Audiobooks, navigation systems, assistive technologies.
    Popular Models: Tacotron 2, WaveNet, VITS.
Audio Classification:
    Why: Identifies sounds or classifies audio events, useful for monitoring and analysis.
    Use Cases: Environmental sound detection, music genre classification, anomaly detection.
    Popular Models: YAMNet, PANNs.


4. Multimodal Tasks
Multimodal tasks combine multiple data types (e.g., text, images) and are increasingly important for advanced AI systems:
Visual Question Answering (VQA):
    Why: Answers questions about images, combining vision and NLP.
    Use Cases: Educational tools, image-based search, accessibility.
    Popular Models: ViLBERT, LXMERT, CLIP-ViT.
Document Question Answering:
    Why: Extracts answers from documents (e.g., PDFs, scanned images), automating information retrieval.
    Use Cases: Legal document analysis, customer support, research.
    Popular Models: LayoutLM, Donut.


5. Other Notable Tasks
These tasks are less common but highly impactful in specific domains:
